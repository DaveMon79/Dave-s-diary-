# Workday Scheduler 

We were asked to take existing code and add to it to create a functional  workday scheduler. It had to include the following functions:

*	Current date displayed at the top of the page
*   Block which display a certain colour based on the current time
*	Text entries which save to localstorage
*	A message which lets the user know an entry has been stored, then disappears
*	Stored user input must display after screen has been refreshed


# Actions taken

I broke the project down into different sections, only moving on once I had that section functioning correctly. I experienced many setbacks once i began coding, as I realising my initial ideas weren't going to work. I found the project a lot more challenging than I'd originally envisaged. 

* Added row sections to HTML
* Renamed hour ID's to simplify the localstorage process
* Added a new section in HTML for the storage alert
* Update CSS to style new section and set as display none
* Wrote Jqery code to make page functional


# Code Style

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery

# Difficulties

This project was deceptively difficult. After previously learning Javascript it was difficult to adjust to the new JQuery syntax, having only seen it for the first time this week. 

Other difficulties:

* Extracting the time and user input to store in local storage
* Making user input display after screen refreshed


# Success

I was able to complete this project with required elements functioning correctly. It was the first time i'd used the following API's:
S
* JQuery 
* Google Fonts
* Bootstrap
* Moment JS
